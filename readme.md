# Road to Azure

This repository follows the path taken to becoming an Azure Solutions Architect Expert through the Azure Data Engineer Associate track. I will be following the free online training through the Azure learning center, while performing deployments and exercises through via the Azure Management Python SDK. The intention is to create a custom SDK wrapper that can be used in future projects.

The following exams will be required:

- DP-200 Implementing an Azure Data Solution
- DP-201 Designing an Azure Data Solution
- AZ-300 Azure Architect Technologies
- AZ-301 Microsoft Azure Architect Design
